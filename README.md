# Python-Regression-Expected-Hospitalization-Time

Build Deep Learning Regression Model with Sequential API and TF Probability Layers

Utilizing a synthetic dataset (denormalized at the line level augmentation) built off of the UCI Diabetes readmission dataset, we will build a regression model that predicts the expected days of hospitalization time and then convert this to a binary prediction of whether to include or exclude that patient from the clinical trial.

This project will demonstrate the importance of building the right data representation at the encounter level, with appropriate filtering and preprocessing/feature engineering of key medical code sets. This project will also analyze and interpret model for biases across key demographic groups.
